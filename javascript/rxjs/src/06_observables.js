/*
Finally we come to observables. The idea here is that we
can subscribe to an observable and get notified when new
data has arrived.

You define streams of data and can listen to them. The 
stream can also transform the data, for example filter or
map data.

Observables are lazy: they only work when someone is 
listening to them. You need to subscribe before anything
will happen in your code.
