# Differences between `var`, `let` and `const`

Some different ways of declaring variables in javascript.
- `scope.js` shows some quirky scoping rules of `var` and how `let` and `const` have lexical scoping.
- `callback.js` has an example of how scoping causes unexpected behavior in callbacks
- `declarations.js` shows how `let` avoids redefinition and `const` avoids reassigning to a variable.
